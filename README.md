SearchEngineV1
==============
At the beginning of our project we decided to split up the work into four parts:

Allocate and Checkpoint: Mitchell Kinney
KeyStorage and Node: Xiaomeng Yang
DiskSpace: Khashi (Last name?)
ValueStorage: Anu (Last name?)

Overall our integration tests failed. Tests that were made for individual classes were successful but unfortunately we were 
not able to combine them to perform well for the combination of the classes. Future work would be dedicated to following the
errors to figure out where the integration test failed.
